"""
Models package.

This package contains machine learning model definitions, training code,
and evaluation utilities. Define model architectures, training procedures,
and evaluation metrics here.

Recommended structure:
- base.py: Abstract base classes and interfaces for models
- training.py: Model training utilities and functions
- evaluation.py: Metrics and evaluation procedures
- inference.py: Prediction and inference utilities
- [model_type].py: Specific model implementations (e.g., linear.py, tree.py)
