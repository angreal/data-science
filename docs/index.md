# Data Science Template

A comprehensive, customizable template for data science projects that follows best practices for project organization, development workflow, and documentation.

## Overview

This template provides a structured foundation for data science projects, emphasizing:

- Organized, modular project structure
- Clear separation of exploratory and production code
- Epoch-based development for tracking experimental progress
- Comprehensive documentation practices
- Testing infrastructure
- Deployment options

The template is designed to be flexible, allowing you to choose which components to include based on your project needs.

## Key Features

- **Modular Project Structure**: Organized layout for code, notebooks, documentation, and tests
- **Epoch-Based Notebook Organization**: Track your experimental progress over time
- **Documentation Framework**: Built-in documentation using MkDocs with the Diátaxis framework
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Pre-configured test directories and utilities
- **Development Tools**: Configured with modern Python development tools
- **Optional Components**:
  - **Database Support**: SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations
  - **Frontend Dashboard**: Streamlit application for data visualization
  - **Deployment Tools**: Docker and deployment scripts for production

## Getting Started

For installation and basic usage, see the [Getting Started](how-to/getting-started.md) guide.

## Best Practices

This template encourages data science best practices:

1. **Experiment Tracking**: Organize notebooks by epochs to track experimental progress
2. **Code Reusability**: Move reusable code from notebooks to the package
3. **Documentation**: Document decisions, experiments, and code
4. **Modular Development**: Separate concerns into distinct modules
5. **Testing**: Write tests for core functionality
6. **Reproducibility**: Track dependencies and environment settings
