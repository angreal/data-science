# Design Decisions

This document explains the key design decisions made in the development of this template and the rationale behind them.

## Core Principles

The template is built around several core principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components should be loosely coupled and independently usable
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple and expand as needed
3. **Convention over configuration**: Sensible defaults with the ability to customize
4. **Reproducibility**: Support for tracking experiments and ensuring results can be reproduced
5. **Maintainability**: Emphasis on clean code, testing, and documentation

These principles guided the specific design decisions detailed below.

## Directory Structure

### Decision: Separate `src` and `notebooks` Directories

**Context**: Data science projects typically include both exploratory code (notebooks) and production code (modules).

**Decision**: Separate these concerns into distinct directories.

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of exploratory vs. production code
- Encourages refactoring notebook code into reusable modules
- Follows established Python package structure practices
- Makes it easier to package and distribute the production code

### Decision: Epoch-Based Notebook Organization

**Context**: Data science projects evolve through multiple phases of exploration and development.

**Decision**: Organize notebooks into "epochs" representing distinct phases.

**Rationale**:
- Provides chronological tracking of project evolution
- Groups related notebooks together
- Documents the progression of ideas and experiments
- Makes it easier to navigate the project history

### Decision: Standardized Module Structure in `src`

**Context**: Data science code often lacks consistent organization.

**Decision**: Use a standardized module structure with clear responsibilities.

**Rationale**:
- Makes code more discoverable and understandable
- Encourages separation of concerns
- Provides clear locations for different types of functionality
- Follows established practices in software engineering

## Configuration System

### Decision: Use Pydantic for Configuration

**Context**: Data science projects often need configuration for different environments (development, production, etc.).

**Decision**: Use Pydantic for configuration management.

**Rationale**:
- Type checking and validation built-in
- Clear error messages for invalid configurations
- Support for complex nested configurations
- Automatic documentation generation
- Widely used and well-maintained

### Decision: Multi-Source Configuration Loading

**Context**: Configuration values may come from different sources.

**Decision**: Load configuration from multiple sources with clear precedence.

**Rationale**:
- Flexibility for different environments
- Security for sensitive values
- Developer convenience
- Follows the principle of least surprise

## Documentation

### Decision: Use MkDocs with Material Theme

**Context**: Documentation is often an afterthought in data science projects.

**Decision**: Include a documentation framework from the start.

**Rationale**:
- Encourages documentation as a core part of development
- Markdown is familiar to data scientists
- Material theme provides a modern, responsive design
- MkDocs is lightweight and easy to use

### Decision: Diátaxis Documentation Structure

**Context**: Documentation needs to serve different purposes for different audiences.

**Decision**: Use the Diátaxis framework to structure documentation.

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and reference
- Each type of documentation has a specific purpose and audience
- Helps ensure complete coverage of documentation needs
- Based on research into documentation effectiveness

## Testing

### Decision: Three-Tier Testing Structure

**Context**: Data science code is often under-tested.

**Decision**: Include a structured testing approach from the start.

**Rationale**:
- Encourages testing as a core part of development
- Separates unit, integration, and functional tests
- Provides clear guidance on what to test and how
- Makes it easier to maintain test suite as the project grows

### Decision: Include Notebook Testing

**Context**: Notebooks are often difficult to test.

**Decision**: Include support for testing notebooks.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures notebooks execute without errors
- Catches issues early in the development process
- Encourages good notebook practices
- Makes it easier to maintain notebooks over time

## Automation and Tooling

### Decision: Use Angreal for Task Automation

**Context**: Data science projects involve many repetitive tasks.

**Decision**: Use Angreal for task automation.

**Rationale**:
- Provides a consistent interface for common tasks
- Reduces manual setup work
- Enforces consistent patterns
- Makes it easier to onboard new team members

### Decision: Include Pre-commit Hooks

**Context**: Code quality is often inconsistent in data science projects.

**Decision**: Include pre-commit hooks for code quality checks.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent code style
- Catches common issues early
- Reduces review burden
- Makes it easier to maintain code quality over time

## Optional Components

### Decision: Make Database, Frontend, and Deployment Optional

**Context**: Not all data science projects need all components.

**Decision**: Make these components optional during project initialization.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces initial complexity for simpler projects
- Allows projects to add components as needed
- Prevents unnecessary dependencies
- Encourages focusing on the core needs first

### Decision: Use SQLAlchemy and Alembic for Database

**Context**: Data science projects often need to store and retrieve data.

**Decision**: Use SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations.

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard ORM with wide adoption
- Strong typing and query capabilities
- Migrations for schema evolution
- Flexibility to work with different database backends

### Decision: Use Streamlit for Frontend

**Context**: Data science projects often need to visualize results.

**Decision**: Use Streamlit for frontend development.

**Rationale**:
- Specifically designed for data science applications
- Low barrier to entry for data scientists
- Rapid development of interactive visualizations
- Good integration with Python data science stack

### Decision: Use Docker for Deployment

**Context**: Deployment is often an afterthought in data science projects.

**Decision**: Include Docker configuration for deployment.

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard containerization
- Ensures consistent environments
- Simplifies deployment process
- Works with various deployment platforms

## Trade-offs and Alternatives Considered

### Structure vs. Flexibility

**Trade-off**: More structure provides clearer guidance but may be too rigid for some projects.

**Decision**: Provide clear structure but allow for customization.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Less structured approach with more freedom (rejected as too chaotic)
- More rigid structure with less customization (rejected as too inflexible)

### Comprehensiveness vs. Simplicity

**Trade-off**: More comprehensive template includes more features but increases complexity.

**Decision**: Core features always included, optional components available as needed.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Minimalist template with only basic structure (rejected as too limited)
- Multiple specialized templates for different use cases (rejected as too fragmented)

### Technology Choices

**Trade-off**: Choosing specific technologies may limit applicability to projects with different needs.

**Decision**: Choose widely-used, general-purpose tools with good Python integration.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Technology-specific templates (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) (may be considered as specializations)
- No technology choices, just structure (rejected as requiring too much additional setup)

## Future Directions

The template is designed to evolve over time. Potential future enhancements include:

1. **Data versioning**: Integration with tools like DVC
2. **Experiment tracking**: Integration with MLflow or similar
3. **Feature store**: Support for feature management
4. **Model registry**: Support for model versioning and management
5. **CI/CD integration**: Pipeline configurations for different platforms
6. **Monitoring**: Support for model and data monitoring

These enhancements would maintain the core principles while expanding the capabilities of the template to support more advanced data science workflows.
