# Explanation

This section provides in-depth explanations of concepts, architecture, and design decisions in the Data Science Template.

## Contents

- [Design Decisions](design-decisions.md): Explains the key design decisions made in the development of this template and the rationale behind them.
- [Epoch-Based Development](epoch-based-development.md): Explains the concept of epoch-based development in data science projects, why it's beneficial, and how to implement it effectively.
- [Extending the Template](extending.md): Guide to customizing and extending the template for your specific needs.

## What is Explanation Documentation?

Explanation documentation provides background information and context that helps you understand the "why" behind the template's design and features. Unlike tutorials or how-to guides, explanations don't focus on specific tasks but rather on concepts and principles.

### When to Use This Section

- When you want to understand the reasoning behind the template's structure
- When you're interested in the principles guiding the template's design
- When you need deeper context about an approach like epoch-based development
- When you're considering extending or customizing the template

## Philosophy of the Template

The Data Science Template is built on several core principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled and can be used independently
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with a simple structure that can be expanded as needed
3. **Convention over Configuration**: Sensible defaults with the ability to customize
4. **Reproducibility**: Support for tracking experiments and ensuring results can be reproduced
5. **Maintainability**: Emphasis on clean code, testing, and documentation

These principles influence every aspect of the template, from the directory structure to the automation tools and optional components.

For more detailed explanations of these principles and how they're implemented, see the individual explanation pages.
