# Epoch-Based Development

This document explains the concept of epoch-based development in data science projects, why it's beneficial, and how to implement it effectively using this template.

## What is Epoch-Based Development?

In the context of this template, an "epoch" represents a distinct phase of experimentation or development in your data science project. Each epoch is a separate directory containing notebooks and supporting files related to that phase.

The term "epoch" is borrowed from machine learning, where it refers to a complete pass through the training dataset. Similarly, an epoch in development represents a complete pass through a phase of your project.

## Why Use Epochs?

### 1. Chronological Tracking

Data science projects evolve through multiple iterations as you explore data, develop features, try different models, and refine your approach. Epochs provide a chronological record of this evolution, making it easier to:

- Track how your approach has changed over time
- Understand the progression of ideas and experiments
- Navigate back to previous approaches when needed
- Document the timeline of your project

### 2. Organizational Clarity

Epochs help organize your work into logical groups, making it easier to:

- Find specific experiments or analyses
- Understand the relationships between different notebooks
- Communicate your approach to others
- Maintain a clear structure as your project grows

### 3. Decision Documentation

Each epoch can document the decisions made and their rationale, providing:

- A record of why certain approaches were chosen or rejected
- Context for understanding current approaches
- Institutional memory for team projects
- Valuable information for onboarding new team members

### 4. Experimental Isolation

Epochs provide a form of isolation between different phases, allowing you to:

- Start fresh with new approaches without deleting previous work
- Compare different approaches side by side
- Maintain a clean workspace for current experiments
- Avoid confusion between old and new approaches

## Implementing Epoch-Based Development

### Creating Epochs

The template provides a convenient command for creating new epochs:

```bash
angreal new epoch --description "Brief description of this phase"
```

This creates a new directory in the `notebooks/` folder with an incrementing number and a README.md file.

### Documenting Epochs

Each epoch should have a README.md file that documents:

1. **Purpose**: What is the goal of this epoch?
2. **Approach**: What methods or techniques are being explored?
3. **Data**: What data sources are being used?
4. **Results**: What were the key findings or outcomes?
5. **Decisions**: What decisions were made based on this epoch?
6. **Next Steps**: What should be explored in the next epoch?

### Organizing Notebooks within Epochs

Within each epoch, notebooks should be organized in a logical sequence, typically chronological. The template uses a naming convention that includes the date, author initials, and a brief description:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_author_initials_short_descriptive_name.ipynb
```

This convention ensures that notebooks are listed in chronological order and provides context about their content and authorship.

### Transitioning Between Epochs

When transitioning from one epoch to another, consider:

1. **Summarizing learnings**: Document key findings and decisions
2. **Refactoring code**: Move reusable code to your source package
3. **Updating documentation**: Update project documentation with new insights
4. **Planning the next epoch**: Define clear objectives for the next phase

## Typical Epoch Progression

A typical data science project might progress through epochs like these:

### Epoch 1: Data Exploration and Understanding

- Exploring data sources and structures
- Assessing data quality and completeness
- Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations
- Formulating initial hypotheses and questions

### Epoch 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Handling missing values
- Correcting errors and inconsistencies
- Transforming variables as needed
- Creating cleaned datasets for analysis

### Epoch 3: Feature Engineering

- Creating new features from existing data
- Testing different feature representations
- Selecting relevant features
- Preparing feature sets for modeling

### Epoch 4: Baseline Modeling

- Implementing simple models as baselines
- Establishing evaluation metrics
- Creating validation frameworks
- Identifying promising approaches

### Epoch 5: Advanced Modeling

- Implementing more complex models
- Tuning hyperparameters
- Ensemble methods
- Comparing performance across models

### Epoch 6: Validation and Refinement

- Rigorous validation of top models
- Addressing edge cases and limitations
- Fine-tuning for production
- Preparing for deployment

### Epoch 7: Production Preparation

- Optimizing for performance
- Integration testing
- Documentation for operations
- Monitoring and maintenance planning

## Best Practices

### Keep Epochs Focused

Each epoch should have a clear focus and objective. If you find yourself working on multiple unrelated tasks, consider creating separate epochs for each.

### Don't Delete Old Epochs

Even if an approach didn't work, keep the epoch for reference. Document what didn't work and why, as this information is valuable for future work.

### Refactor Code Between Epochs

As your understanding evolves, refactor common code into your source package. This reduces duplication and makes your code more maintainable.

### Review and Reflect

At the end of each epoch, take time to review what you've learned and reflect on how it should influence your next steps. Update your project documentation accordingly.

### Balance Structure and Flexibility

While epochs provide structure, don't let them constrain your exploration. Create new epochs when needed, and don't force work to fit into an existing epoch if it represents a distinct phase.

## Example: Epoch Documentation

Here's an example of what a well-documented epoch README might look like:

```markdown
# Epoch 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation

**Started**: 2024-05-01
**Completed**: 2024-05-15
**Objectives**: Clean and prepare data for feature engineering and modeling

## Overview

This epoch focuses on addressing data quality issues identified in Epoch 1, including missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. The goal is to create a clean, reliable dataset for feature engineering and modeling.

## Key Tasks

1. Handle missing values using appropriate imputation techniques
2. Identify and address outliers
3. Correct inconsistencies in categorical variables
4. Normalize or standardize numerical features
5. Create a validated clean dataset

## Notebooks

1. `2024-05-01_ds_missing_value_analysis.ipynb`: Analysis of missing values and imputation strategies
2. `2024-05-05_ds_outlier_detection.ipynb`: Identifying and handling outliers
3. `2024-05-10_ds_categorical_cleaning.ipynb`: Cleaning and encoding categorical variables
4. `2024-05-15_ds_final_dataset_creation.ipynb`: Creating the final cleaned dataset

## Key Findings

- Missing values are primarily concentrated in columns X, Y, and Z
- Multiple imputation performed better than simple mean/median imputation
- Outliers in feature A are genuine extreme values and should be kept
- Feature B shows significant skew and benefits from log transformation

## Decisions

- Use multiple imputation for handling missing values
- Keep outliers in feature A, treat outliers in other features case by case
- Apply log transformation to features B and C
- Create a consistent encoding scheme for categorical variables

## Next Steps

- Proceed to feature engineering using the cleaned dataset
- Focus on creating interaction features between A and B
- Explore dimensionality reduction techniques
```

## Relationship to Other Development Approaches

Epoch-based development complements other development approaches:

### Agile Development

Epochs can align with agile sprints, with each epoch representing a sprint or group of sprints focused on a specific aspect of the project.

### Git Workflow

Epochs can be managed alongside git branches, with each epoch potentially having its own branch or feature branches.

### MLOps

Epochs provide a natural structure for MLOps workflows, with models and artifacts from each epoch being tracked and versioned.

## Conclusion

Epoch-based development provides a structured yet flexible approach to organizing data science work. By dividing your project into distinct phases, you can better track your progress, document your decisions, and communicate your approach to others.

The template's tools for creating and managing epochs make it easy to implement this approach, while the standardized directory structure and documentation templates ensure consistency across your project.

By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this document, you can effectively use epochs to enhance the organization, reproducibility, and maintainability of your data science projects.
